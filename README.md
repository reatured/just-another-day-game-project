## Overview

> _"It has been my daily routine for quite a while... but why?"_

**Just Another Day** is a quiet, unsettling game that explores the blurred edges between habit and heartbreak. Each level unfolds across five distinct mini-games, each one symbolizing part of the protagonist’s daily routine—cooking, painting, walking, sleeping—but beneath the repetition lies something deeper.

As players move forward, subtle changes and small narrative details begin to form a powerful, emotional arc. By the end, the routine loops back with a clarity that’s both beautiful and devastating.
